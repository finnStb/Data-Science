      "Text: The whole PENTHOUSE is available for events your caterer or one I can recommend.   But with my permission read on AND  s.v.p. plan in advance.   It's a \"quiet house\" so events like small graduation parties, corporate parties, small meet and greets are examples of good ideas for the space.   Bachelor parties, weddings, grooms dinners are not possible.   Although it's a good space for the Bride and Groom to stay if you plan to hold your reception at nearby venus.   THAT SAID, it's also a Quiet Spot on a quiet street in an historic (1860) neighborhood, ideal for professionals \"working-out-of -the-house, for authors, photographers, graduate students who need to study, or for people attending or presenting at conferences.     Check out is at 11am.      The apartment is completely private as is the patio...   The laundry room and mail room are both off the common foyer..    Please keep  TV, HULU,  Blu Ray DVD and music at a reasonable level between 7am and 11pm.      Maximum of two guests.  \n",

      "Text: If you are new to Airbnb, the idea is that I’m not renting a room, but rather sharing my home. I live and work here, and enjoy meeting new people. It's like having old friends visit, not like a hotel. You are welcome to make yourself at home in the common living areas and to use the kitchen, but please leave everything as clean and put away as you have found it. As we will be sharing a bathroom, I appreciate your tidying up and keeping personal items in your room. The cat is not allowed outdoors – he can be sneaky so please don’t leave doors open and keep an eye out for him. You are welcome to the kitchen (and common areas), thank you for cleaning your dishes after using them.   I am environmentally friendly and appreciate you being mindful as well.  Thank you for being considerate and for treating the home as you would yours.  Please turn off lights, fans (and AC or heaters when available) when not in the bedroom.  Always lock doors and first floor windows when outside of the home.  P\n",

      "Text: Unlike most other Airbnb listings, what we do here is long-term rentals by the year, or by the semester.  We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.  1. Towels and linens (sheets, blankets, and pillows) are NOT provided. The bed is twin size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your o\n",

Probably before 3pm, during the school year at about 1pm usually. In the dead of winter, esp. if there is a lot of snow there may be delays.  If you have really specific needs, you should speak up ahead of time.  NOTE although i do try to keep the apartments stocked with toilet paper and soap i do not make additional trips to the apartments to replenish them. Try to sort out recycling, take out recycling/ trash to the alley bins if you can.  Do not leave trash laying around, especially outside. Please communicate, communicate, communicate. \n",

      "Text: Unlike most other Airbnb listings, what we do here is long-term rentals by the year, or by the semester and we can welcome compatible short-term guests.  We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.    1. No smoking on the premises.  2. No loud music or TV etc.   3. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.   4. If you re not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.   5. Check-in time is flexible, but it has to be coordinated at least 24 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.\n",

Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your own flip-flops, slippers or some kind of indoor shoes, that will be useful.\n",

We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.    1. No smoking on the premises.  2. No loud music or TV etc.   3. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.   4. If you re not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.   5. Check-in time is flexible, but it has to be coordinated at least 24 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.\n",

Probably before 3pm, during the school year at about 1pm usually. In the dead of winter, esp. if there is a lot of snow there may be delays.  If you have really specific needs, you should speak up ahead of time.
